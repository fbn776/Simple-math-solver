/**
 * A very rough infix notation solver. It doesn't respect the order of precedence. It solves from left to right. (Why?, because solving an infix respecting its operator presidency wasn't the aim.);
 * @property[solve] This function takes in [MutableList<String>] and returns the solved answer as a [Float].
 * Warning: This doesn't error check
